# RIP Magia Record
Mitama's Home is an Cydia based iOS package that injects into Magia Record NA binary and offers you a wide range of utilities:
- Swapping out a card in battles
- Editing a card's attributes in battles
- Editing the enemy's attributes in battles
- Speeding up the game by up to 3x
- In-game creation of characters
- In-game debugging console
- In-game memory access

This was developed in 2020, when Magia Record NA was still running. Now that all Magia Record servers have been shut down, I am releasing this to commemorate the game that accompanied me during the tough COVID lockdown time.
